# Battleship

This project is a web-based "Battleship" game I made for "The Odin Project". For this project, I attempted to recreate the game "Battleship" in javascript, employing Test-Driven Design (TDD). In the future, I plan to go back to this task to further style it and to better the code organization.

While working on this project I...

* Learned to used Jest for testing
* Employed Test-Driven Design (TDD) to formulate modules and test logic
* Learned to seperate javascript functionality across different modules
